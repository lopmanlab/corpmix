## Abstract
<b>Importance</b>
Accurate data on social mixing patterns are critical for the development of valid mathematical models that simulate disease transmission dynamics and inform health policy and investment strategies. However, there has been no standardized multi-site social mixing study conducted in workplace settings in the United States that can be used to broadly inform pandemic preparedness policy in these settings.

<b>Objective</b>
The study usedstandardized social contact diaries to characterize the patterns of social contacts and mixing across workplace environments, including on-site or when teleworking.

<b>Design</b>
This was a cross-sectionalnon-probability survey. Employees were requested to record their physical and non-physical contacts in a diary over two consecutive days, documented at the end of each day. Employees from each company were enrolled through email and electronic diaries sent as individual links. Data were collected from April to June 2020.

<b>Setting</b>
Two multinational consulting companies and one university administrative department, all located in Georgia, USA.ParticipantsEmployees opted into the study by accepting the invitation on a link sent via email.

<b>Main Outcome</b>
The outcome was median number of contacts per person per day. This was stratified by day of data collection, age, sex, race and ethnicity.

<b>Results</b>
Of 3,895 employees approached, 357(9.6%)completedthe first day of contact diary of which 304 completedboth days of contact diary. There was amedian of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4, range: 0-21) per respondent on both day one and two. The majority (55%) of contacts involved conversation only, occurred at home (64%), and cumulatively lasted more than 4 hours (38%). Most contacts were repeated, andwithin same age groups,though 30-59 year-old participants reported substantialinter-generational mixingwith children.

<b>Conclusion</b>
Participating employees in 3 surveyed workplaces reported few contacts,similar to studies from the UK and Chinawhen shelter-in-place orders were in effect during the pandemic. Many contacts were repeated whichmay limit the spread of infection. Future rounds are planned to assess changes in contact patterns when employees resume work in the office.
